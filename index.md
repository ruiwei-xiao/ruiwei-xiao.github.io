<section id="about" class="about-section">
  I'm a 2nd Year PhD Student in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Professor <a href="https://dev.stamper.org/">John Stamper</a>. I am also the co-founder of <a href="https://www.active-ai.io/">ActiveAI</a>. My research focuses on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors&hl=en&mauthors=label:ai_in_education">AI in Education</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors&hl=en&mauthors=label:ai_literacy">AI Literacy</a> using quantitative (e.g., A/B testing, statistical analysis) and qualitative methods (e.g., thematic coding), currently centered on two cross-cultural, multi-institutional projects:
